SuperCSS is a utility CSS framework for tailwind-like design and speed of development.

# Usage
With _no configuration needed_, just add this to your `<head>` tag...

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/the-supercss-project/supercss/dist/output.css" />
```

# Performance and Minification
Unlike Tailwind, it does not include minification and removal of unused classes directly. You should improve performance by downloading our stylesheets and using a 3rd party tool like [**PurgeCSS**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/purgecss).
